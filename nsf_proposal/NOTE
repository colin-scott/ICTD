Criterion: 
========== Intellectual Merit ================

 How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and
 understanding within its own field or across different fields?

 How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the
 project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of prior
 work.)

 To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative,
 original, or potentially transformative concepts?

 How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity?

 Is there sufficient access to resources?

 Panelists will consider factors including: the strength of the academic
record, the proposed plan of research and whether it is potentially
transformative, the description of previous research experience, references,
and the appropriateness of the choice of institution relative to the proposed
plan for graduate education and research.

Demonstrated intellectual ability 
• Ability to:
• Plan and conduct research
• Work as a member of a team and work 
independently
• Interpret & communicate research findings


  
=============  Broader Impacts ==========

 How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while
 promoting teaching, training, and learning?

 How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of
 underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic,
 etc.)?

 To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and
 education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships?

 Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and
 technological understanding?

 What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?

 The broader impacts criterion includes contributions that infuse learning
 with the excitement of discovery, and assure that the findings and methods of
 research are communicated in a broad context and to a large audience.
 A strong application will encourage diversity, broaden opportunities, and
 enable the participation of all citizens-women and men, underrepresented
 minorities, and persons with disabilities-in science and research.
 In addition to reaching a broad audience, a strong application must
 demonstrate how it will enhance scientific and technical understanding, while
 benefiting society.
 Applicants may provide characteristics of their background, including
 personal, professional, and educational experiences, to indicate their
 potential to fulfill the broader impacts criterion.

================= Notes to myself: ==============================

Work on research essay first. Do this with a group, absolutely.

Reviewing past literature:
   - How does this inform what I'm going to do
   - Should be fairly short

State that I have the resources I need.

Explicit section: what are your intellectual merits, what are you broader impacts. Specific phrases from the prompt. italicize the words. References can be 10pt font. everthing else 12pt font. Abbreviated reference titles.

Personal statement: some anectode that illustrates the idea you want to get across. Be specific.

Past research: all of these essays should be different sides of the same coin. Justify that you are prepared to do the research in the research proposal. If you want to completely change research topics, now is not the time to do that. NOT I did this project, here's what I did. How do these enable me to do the research I propose to do. Introduction. 

Essays available in the fellowship office. Also:

tinyurl.com/berkeleynsf

If you haven't started, start now.

Enumerate expected results from your research proposal. 

SEND OUT DRAFTS EARLY AND OFTEN.

How did I develop into a researcher and as a person through my past research experience?

Looking for enthusiasm in all essays. Still developing, still looking for ways to improve myself. Learn how to communicate well, succintly, and quickly.

You can read what the criteria are online. Highly wired people, in a hot room, read them as quickly as they can. Every app. is read twice.

It's an as-if dissertation -- just need to know that I can articulate a research proposal clearly.

Understand: 
  - How to concpetualize a question
  - What current methods are for working on it

Show all of your letter writers your proposal! They should write their letters tied in to the writeup. Typos are a death kiss.

We read all FYGs in a group. Largest part of GRFPs go to FYGs, not seniors. 

Broader impact: Communicate that you are going to make a commitment to communicate to the public. I blog. I talk to other people about why my research is important and has impact. I educate other people. k
