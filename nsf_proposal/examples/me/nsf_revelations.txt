* I've been living at the wrong layer of abstraction. Argumentation is far more
* important than implementation.

* Writing that NSF application made me want to go out and write a top-notch
* research proposal. That proposal was terrible. I know I can do better.

* Attitude determines /everything/.

* I wasn't driven by enjoyment. I was /so/ passive. I just sat in my little
* logical tower above the clouds. Enjoyment, sadness, disatisfaction,
* annoyance. Those were all just passive events that I was observing. Being
* driven by enjoyment is very imporant. That's where creativity comes from.

* I'm a better scientist than I am an engineer.

* I wanted to go to graduate school because I admired academics. That's not a
* particularly good reason. A much better motive would be "I really enjoy
* thinking about these problems. I want to discover new properties of the
* Internet." Of course, I do enjoy thinking about these problems. But that was
* secondary. My motivation was almost entirely driven by the fact that I
* wanted to be like someone else.

* I never really had vision. My awareness was /extremely/ constricted to
* whichever particular problem I was working on at the moment. I didn't ever
* step back and ask myself, "how does this fit into the bigger picture"
* To be succesful, you have to have vision. You have to think to yourself,  "What should the Internet look
like? How should we design things? What are the important problems? How should
we go about solving them?"

* In a similar vein, I spend /way/ too much time in the office. The NSF
* panelists are looking for someone who wants to give back to society, who is a
* /leader/. I'm fairly oblivious to those sorts of things. And they're
* important things. -- I have a strong desire to TA.

* I want to defer a year. I don't think I can write a convincing application
* letter, because I haven't yet convinced /myself/ why I want to do it.  I haven't had enough time to step back and ask myself
* "Why am I doing this"? I need to develop a passion for /research/, and grow
* out of my simple desire to be like the academics. I haven't had enough time to think about the
* meaning of research impact. I need to think more about
* what /specifically/ I want to work on. Up until now, it's just been "I like
* building distributed systems. Also, I'm good at this". But I haven't given
* much thought into /why/ I like building distributed systems. Why is it
* /important/. Why is /research/ better than engineering?
