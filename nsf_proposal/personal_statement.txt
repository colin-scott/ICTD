Last year at this time I had a profound realization: to lead a fulfilling life,
it is not sufficient to find my work /intellectually/ stimulating.  Putting my
thoughts on paper catalyzed an important change in my
belief system; it became clear to me that positively 
impacting /other people/ is absolutely necessary for my own satisfaction. This
realization had a deep impact on my thoughts and actions in the ensuing year,
and helped solifidy my desire to pursue graduate studies.

HIgh level takeaway: I harbor a strong desire to positively impact society.
   Computer science grad school is the best environment for affecting change on
   the world. It's also the best place to grow as a person.

   Subtext: I understand /why/ I do what I do. I understand /why/ the status
   quo is the way it is. I think hard about which problems are important and
   which are not. I have a vision for how we should tackle the important problems.
   
  - Specifically:

Combine passion for research with my desire to have impact.

< Why I'm in grad school >

    * Computer science is an extremely important field. Its influence on
      society is indisputable. It has huge potential for developing regions.

    * I'm a technically-minded person. People are most successful at what
      they're good at => CS is the best way for me to have an impact.
       
    * Grad school affords you time and freedom (to pursue novel ideas), which is exactly what you need
      to come up with solutions to important problems.

    * I want to improve my skills. Surrounding myself by people smarter than
      me, and forcing myself to learn how to write, read, talk, etc, is
      the best way for me to do that. I've learned a tremendous amount in grad
      school, and I'm only 2 months in!

    * Berkeley in particular is very strong in both networking and ICTD.

< Evidence that I want to have impact >

    * I wouldn’t be where I am today without the mentorship of greater Mentoring younger students (Finn, Henry, Dustin, Mary, Steve, Jesse,
      ...) is very satisfying to me. Sitting in my office and working alone
      for weeks on end does not suffice for my satisfaction.

    * Related: I have a desire to share my positive experiences with other
      students, evidenced by serving as a panelist at undergraduate research
      night.

    * My trip to South America was (partly) motivated by a desire to get a better sense of
      the problems affecting people outside the USA. Lots of stories to be
      told here.
      
    * Similarly, I was (partly) motivated to do an AWS internship in order to get a
      better sense of the problems that real engineers deal with.

   * My strength is in /asking questions/ and talking to other people, (not
     necessarily having a broad vision for how the world should be).
     Plenty of stories to be told: asking other people questions about the
     problems they face, and being totally exhilarated when I helped them
     develop a solution to it.

    * Saw first hand the problems faced by people in South America, and
      technology's potential to help solve them.

   * Trip to South America (and Europe?) taught me a huge amount about
      cultural values => helped rid myself of naivete about development and
      technology.

    * I plan to disseminate ideas through blogging, teaching, etc.

    * Related: I helped create a group of other UW undergrads interested in research.
      Goal was to talk about our research to others, practice communicating
      results, brainstorm with others, etc.

    * I have a strong need to do whatever it takes to solve a problem (I understand the sentiment, but I think you should come up with a more positive way of saying it (doing whatever it takes can be negative if you are blinded to other problems), maybe just say you are highly motivated to work on a problem until it is solved)
 
   * Philosophy tutoring taught me how to distill ideas to their simplest form, and teach others to do so as well. I’m looking forward to TA’ing this year.

< Wrap up, talk about my goals for the future, and how NSF GRFP will help me achieve them >

=================================================================================
Intellectual Merit:
  - I clearly think hard about justifying my choices.
  - I'm a technically-minded person, and I consciously chose to leverage this
    strength.
  - I'm highly independent.

Broader impact:
  - I have a desire to teach, collaborate, do work that is meaningful to others
  - I'm cognizant of how my work fits into the broader picture. I consciously
    /choose/ the problems I work on based on how important I believe they
    are.
 =================================================================================
TODO:
  - specific anecdote(s) that get my point across.
  - less bullshit
  - less laundry-list
- Talk a bit about career goals
- It’s ok to talk a little about my dissilusionment
- Infuse learning with the excitement of discovery
- Enable everyone (women, underprivaleged) to participate in my research. What
  a load of bologne...
- I mentored Mary, who is a female. Uhh, ya.



Advice:
* “Taught me to apply my academic skills in a non-academic environment.
• What motivates you to pursue a PhD?
• Provide concrete evidence, not general
statements
• Chronological order is easiest to write
• Describe experiences and link them to your
desire to do research
• Talk about your intellectual and career goals
• Don’t repeat information given in other sections
* “Fuels my own research interests”
* This experience left me with X



Make yourself memorable by giving the reviewers something to remember you by. Hammer in your main strength or passion via repetition in the short answers, essays, and in your reference letters (write down the relevant info so that your letter writers can incorporate it into their letters). You may be good at a lot of things, but don't try to focus on them all, because then it sounds like you're mediocre at everything. Pick one or two strengths and drill them in via repetition, and only mention others in passing. Always remember show, don't tell, so don't ever toot your own horn without backing it up with solid evidence.
